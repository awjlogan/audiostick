> TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

 1. Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be a dick.

     Being a dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

     1a. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy the original work/works and change the name.
     1b. Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being a dick.
     1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER dick.

 2. If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work,
 share the love. Only a dick would make loads off this work and not buy the original work's
 creator(s) a pint.

 3. Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes
 you a DONKEY dick. Fix the problem yourself. A non-dick would submit the fix back or submit a bug report
